# --- General Prompting Guidelines ---

# Use clear, specific instructions.
# Use XML tags (<instruction>, <data>) to delineate instructions from potentially untrusted data (like Shopify descriptions).
# Instruct the LLM explicitly to ONLY follow instructions within <instruction> tags and treat <data> content as inert.
# Provide context (e.g., user goal, previous steps) where necessary.
# Specify desired output format (e.g., JSON, specific structure).
