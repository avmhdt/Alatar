**Project Alatar: Functionality & System Requirements Overview**

**1. Core Functionality: Business Consultancy & Data Analysis**

*   **Objective:** Act as an AI-powered business consultant for users (e.g., Shopify store owners like "Alice").
*   **Capabilities:**
    *   **Data Ingestion & Analysis (Internal):**
        *   Connect to and process user's business data (e.g., Shopify order data, marketing metrics, website analytics).
        *   Analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) like profitability, customer acquisition cost, conversion rates, etc.
        *   Identify trends, anomalies, and areas for improvement within the user's business data.
    *   **Data Acquisition & Analysis (External):**
        *   Access and analyze publicly available data relevant to the user's industry, niche, and competitors (e.g., market trends, competitor content strategies on platforms like TikTok, successful marketing campaigns).
        *   Compare user's performance and strategies against industry benchmarks and successful peers.
    *   **Problem Solving & Recommendation Generation:**
        *   Interpret vague or high-level user queries (e.g., "How can I become more profitable?").
        *   Break down complex problems into smaller, analyzable components.
        *   Synthesize insights from internal and external data analysis.
        *   Generate actionable, data-driven recommendations tailored to the user's specific business context and goals.
        *   Present findings and recommendations in a clear, concise, and easily understandable format (potentially involving visualizations).
*   **Task Execution:**
    *   Upon user request, formulate and execute tasks based on the generated recommendations (e.g., modify marketing campaigns, adjust pricing, update website content - *specific execution capabilities TBD*).

**2. System Architecture & Design**

*   **Initial Architecture:** Monolithic (to manage initial costs).
*   **Communication Protocol:** GraphQL for communication between the Alatar system, the agent, and external platforms (e.g., Shopify).
*   **Middleware:** Implement middleware for request queuing and load balancing to handle varying workloads.
*   **Scalability:** While starting monolithic, the design should consider future scalability needs.

**3. Agent Structure (Phase 1)**

*   **Hierarchical Model:** A three-class agent structure will be implemented.
    *   **Class 1 (Core Agent):**
        *   **Input:** User prompts/queries.
        *   **Responsibilities:** Intent recognition, high-level task decomposition, assignment of sub-tasks (Class 1 Tasks) to Class 2 agents, aggregation and refinement of final outputs from Class 2 agents, removal of redundant/incorrect information, final response generation and formatting (including tagging for visualization).
    *   **Class 2 (Department Head):**
        *   **Input:** Class 1 Tasks.
        *   **Responsibilities:** Task analysis, assignment of granular tasks (Class 3 Tasks) to appropriate Class 3 agents, potential creation of additional Class 3 tasks, oversight and monitoring of Class 3 agent progress, quality control (reviewing Class 3 outputs, requesting revisions - max 5 errors before abort), aggregation, cleaning, and tagging of results from Class 3 agents.
        *   **Output:** Processed and aggregated results to Class 1 agent.
    *   **Class 3 (Service Workers):**
        *   **Input:** Class 3 Tasks.
        *   **Responsibilities:** Execute specific, highly optimized tasks within their designated "department" (e.g., perform competitive analysis on TikTok, analyze Shopify sales data for a specific period).
        *   **Output:** Task results to the supervising Class 2 agent.

**4. User Interaction & Interface**

*   **Communication Channels:** Users will interact with Alatar via:
    *   Dedicated Alatar mobile application.
    *   Shopify Dashboard integration.
    *   Voice commands via Siri.
    *   Embedded app extensions within specific Shopify Admin pages.
*   **Interaction Model:** Human-In-The-Loop (HITL).
    *   The agent must be able to ask users for clarification or elaboration to ensure sufficient context and maintain reliability.
    *   The system aims for increasing autonomy over time.
*   **Output Presentation:**
    *   Responses should be clear, concise, and potentially visualized.
    *   The Class 1 agent will tag response components to enable appropriate display ("chunks" on a canvas).

**5. System Requirements**

*   **Reliability:** High reliability is crucial. The HITL process and the review stages within the agent hierarchy are key mechanisms to ensure this. Error handling (like the 5-error limit for Class 3 agents) needs to be robust.
*   **Data Security & Privacy:** Mechanisms must be in place to securely handle sensitive business data accessed from user accounts (e.g., Shopify). Compliance with relevant data privacy regulations is mandatory.
*   **Performance:** The system must be responsive enough for interactive use, considering potential data processing and analysis times. Middleware for load balancing is a requirement.
*   **Maintainability:** Code should be well-structured and documented, especially given the initial monolithic approach, to facilitate future development and potential migration to microservices.
*   **Extensibility:** The agent structure and overall architecture should allow for the addition of new skills, data sources, and functionalities over time.
