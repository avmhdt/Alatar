# Worker Setup

The project employs a worker-based system for background tasks or distributed processing. The specific roles of the workers seem to be:

- **Base/Common Worker Logic:** Likely found in [worker.py](mdc:worker.py).
- **Data Retrieval:** Handled by [worker_data_retrieval.py](mdc:worker_data_retrieval.py).
- **Quantitative Analysis:** Handled by [worker_quantitative_analysis.py](mdc:worker_quantitative_analysis.py).
- **Qualitative Analysis:** Handled by [worker_qualitative_analysis.py](mdc:worker_qualitative_analysis.py).
- **Recommendation Generation:** Handled by [worker_recommendation_generation.py](mdc:worker_recommendation_generation.py).
- **Action Execution:** Handled by [worker_action_execution.py](mdc:worker_action_execution.py).
- **Predictive Analysis:** Handled by [worker_predictive_analysis.py](mdc:worker_predictive_analysis.py).
- **Comparative Analysis:** Handled by [worker_comparative_analysis.py](mdc:worker_comparative_analysis.py).

Configuration and orchestration of these workers are likely managed through [docker-compose.yml](mdc:docker-compose.yml) and potentially [docker-compose.prod.yml](mdc:docker-compose.prod.yml).
